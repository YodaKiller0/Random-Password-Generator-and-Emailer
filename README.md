# Random-Password-Generator-and-Emailer

The goal of this project would be to create a Python script that generates a random password and sends it to your email address. The script could work as follows:

1. Generate a random password using Python's built-in random module.
2. Use an external library like PyEmail to send an email to your desired email address.
3. In the email body, include the generated password along with any other relevant information you'd like to include (e.g. a message indicating that this is a password reset or a new account creation).
4. Use the command line or a GUI interface to prompt the user to enter their email address and any other necessary information (e.g. email server credentials).
5. Once the user has provided all necessary information, run the script to generate the password and send the email.

This project could be a fun way to practice working with external libraries, as well as creating a command line or GUI interface for user input. Additionally, it could be a useful tool for generating secure, randomized passwords on the fly.

# Edit the Code first
1. Open the passwordtoemail.py file using VSCode or any other preferred editor.
2. Then edit these lines <br>
```python
# 1st line
sender_email = 'Enter your email'

sender_password = 'Enter your app password'
```
Example ⬇️
```python
sender_password = 'v7xhwiasyem6lgynx'
```
